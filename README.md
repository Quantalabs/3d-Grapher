# 3d-Grapher

## Simple. Fast. Accurate.
The flexibility you need in a simple framework designed to accomodate everything from scene rendering to vector fields.
Here's what you can do:
 - Multiple Perspectives
 - 3d Animations
 - Vector Fields
 - Scene Lighting
 - Surface Plotting
Everything can be described mathematically (graph of x, y axes, parametric, etc.) or as a more natural series of planes stacked on top of each other to form basic shapes (i.e. a cube). This flexibility allows for faster 3d graphics and speeds up the design process immensely.
